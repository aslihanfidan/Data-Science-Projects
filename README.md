## üìÅ Projects Included

### 1. LMS Model Comparison & Explainability
- **Topic:** Predicting training outcomes and analyzing model behavior.
- **Techniques Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SHAP values
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP), Kaggle Notebooks
- **Goal:** To compare model performances and understand which features impact predictions the most.

### 2. Churn Prediction (Coming soon / Under development)
- **Topic:** Customer churn prediction using classification models.
- **Focus:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
