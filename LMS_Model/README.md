### LMS Model Comparison & Explainability
- **Topic:** Predicting training outcomes and analyzing model behavior.
- **Techniques Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SHAP values
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP), Kaggle Notebooks
- **Goal:** To compare model performances and understand which features impact predictions the most.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)
- SHAP (for model explainability)
- Jupyter / Kaggle Notebooks
- GitHub for version control
